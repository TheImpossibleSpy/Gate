## Introduction to Friction

Friction is the resistive force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. It is not a fundamental force but arises from electromagnetic forces between atoms and molecules.

### Types of Friction

1.  **Dry Friction (Coulomb Friction):** Occurs between non-lubricated surfaces.
2.  **Fluid Friction:** Occurs between layers of fluids moving at different velocities.
3.  **Internal Friction:** Occurs within solid materials during deformation.

In GATE Engineering Mechanics, we primarily focus on **Dry Friction**.

## Laws of Dry Friction (Coulomb's Laws)

The laws of dry friction are empirical in nature:

1.  The frictional force always acts in a direction opposite to that of the motion (or impending motion).
2.  The magnitude of the maximum static frictional force, $f_s$, is proportional to the normal reaction force, $N$.
3.  The magnitude of the kinetic frictional force, $f_k$, is proportional to the normal reaction force, $N$.
4.  The frictional force is independent of the apparent area of contact.
5.  The coefficient of kinetic friction ($\mu_k$) is usually less than the coefficient of static friction ($\mu_s$).

<Formula title="Friction Formulas">

$$ f_s \le \mu_s N $$
$$ f_{s,max} = \mu_s N $$
$$ f_k = \mu_k N $$

</Formula>

Where:
*   $f_s$ = Static frictional force
*   $\mu_s$ = Coefficient of static friction
*   $f_k$ = Kinetic frictional force
*   $\mu_k$ = Coefficient of kinetic friction
*   $N$ = Normal reaction force

## Free Body Diagram with Friction

Below is a diagram showing the forces acting on a block on a horizontal surface being pulled by a force $P$.

## Angle of Friction ($\phi$)

The angle of friction is the angle which the resultant of the limiting friction ($f_{s,max}$) and normal reaction ($N$) makes with the normal reaction.

$$ \tan \phi_s = \frac{f_{s,max}}{N} = \frac{\mu_s N}{N} = \mu_s $$

<Formula>

$$ \phi_s = \tan^{-1}(\mu_s) $$

</Formula>

## Angle of Repose ($\theta$)

The angle of repose is the maximum angle of an inclined plane at which a block placed on it remains in equilibrium solely under the action of gravity and friction.

It can be shown that the angle of repose is equal to the angle of static friction.

$$ \theta = \phi_s $$

## Previous Year Questions (PYQ)

<PYQ year="2018" marks="2">

A block of mass 10 kg rests on a rough horizontal surface. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the surface is 0.4. A horizontal force P is applied to the block. If $g = 9.81 m/s^2$, the maximum value of P for which the block remains at rest is:

**(A) 9.81 N**
**(B) 19.62 N**
**(C) 39.24 N**
**(D) 98.1 N**

**Solution:**
The maximum static friction force is $f_{s,max} = \mu_s N$.
Vertical equilibrium: $N = mg = 10 \times 9.81 = 98.1 \, \text{N}$.
$f_{s,max} = 0.4 \times 98.1 = 39.24 \, \text{N}$.
For the block to remain at rest, $P \le f_{s,max}$.
Max $P = 39.24 \, \text{N}$.
