## Syllabus Reference
Matrices, types of matrices, algebra of matrices, properties of matrices, transpose, inverse of matrices.

## 1. What is a Matrix?

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns, used to represent systems of linear equations and linear transformations.

If a matrix has `m` rows and `n` columns, its order is `m × n`.

---

## 2. Types of Matrices

### (a) Row Matrix
A matrix having only one row.

```

[ 1  2  3 ]

```

---

### (b) Column Matrix
A matrix having only one column.

```

[ 1 ]
[ 2 ]
[ 3 ]

```

---

### (c) Square Matrix
A matrix with equal number of rows and columns.

```

[ 1  2 ]
[ 3  4 ]

```

---

### (d) Diagonal Matrix
A square matrix in which all non-diagonal elements are zero.

```

[ 2  0  0 ]
[ 0  5  0 ]
[ 0  0  1 ]

```

---

### (e) Identity Matrix
A diagonal matrix in which all diagonal elements are unity.

```

[ 1  0 ]
[ 0  1 ]

```

---

### (f) Symmetric Matrix
A matrix is symmetric if  
Aᵀ = A

Example:
```

[ 1  2 ]
[ 2  3 ]

```

---

### (g) Skew-Symmetric Matrix
A matrix is skew-symmetric if  
Aᵀ = −A

Diagonal elements are always zero.

Example:
```

[ 0   2 ]
[ -2  0 ]

```

---

### (h) Orthogonal Matrix
A matrix A is orthogonal if  
AᵀA = I

---

## 3. Algebra of Matrices

### (a) Matrix Addition
Matrix addition is defined only when matrices have the same order.

```

A + B = [aᵢⱼ + bᵢⱼ]

```

---

### Example 1: Matrix Addition

```

A = [ 1  2 ]      B = [ 4  3 ]
[ 3  4 ]          [ 2  1 ]

A + B = [ 5  5 ]
[ 5  5 ]

```

---

### (b) Scalar Multiplication
Each element of the matrix is multiplied by the scalar.

```

kA = [ k·aᵢⱼ ]

```

---

## 4. Matrix Multiplication

### Condition
If A is of order m × n and B is of order n × p, then  
AB exists and is of order m × p.

---

### Properties
- AB ≠ BA (non-commutative)
- (AB)C = A(BC) (associative)
- A(B + C) = AB + AC (distributive)

---

### Example 2: Non-Commutativity

```

A = [ 1  2 ]      B = [ 0  1 ]
[ 3  4 ]          [ 1  0 ]

AB = [ 2  1 ]
[ 4  3 ]

BA = [ 3  4 ]
[ 1  2 ]

```

Hence, AB ≠ BA.

---

## 5. Transpose of a Matrix

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging its rows and columns.

```

(Aᵀ)ᵢⱼ = Aⱼᵢ

```

---

### Properties of Transpose
- (Aᵀ)ᵀ = A
- (A + B)ᵀ = Aᵀ + Bᵀ
- (AB)ᵀ = BᵀAᵀ

---

### Example 3: Transpose

```

A  = [ 1  2 ]
[ 3  4 ]

Aᵀ = [ 1  3 ]
[ 2  4 ]

```

---

## 6. Special Matrix Identities

- AI = IA = A  
- A0 = 0A = 0  
- A² = A · A  
- Aⁿ = A multiplied n times  

---

### Example 4: Power of a Matrix

```

A = [ 1  1 ]
[ 0  1 ]

A² = [ 1  2 ]
[ 0  1 ]

```

---

## 7. Invertible and Singular Matrices

- A matrix is invertible if its determinant is non-zero.
- If det(A) = 0, the matrix is singular and has no inverse.

---

## 8. Common GATE Mistakes

- Ignoring matrix order before multiplication  
- Assuming AB = BA  
- Forgetting transpose reversal rule  
- Performing illegal matrix operations  
- Treating zero matrix like identity matrix  

---

## 9. Quick Revision

- Matrix multiplication is order-sensitive  
- Identity matrix behaves like number 1  
- Transpose reverses multiplication order  
- Symmetric matrix: Aᵀ = A  
- Skew-symmetric matrix: Aᵀ = −A  
- Diagonal matrices simplify calculations
